<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.</p>
<h2>Class body</h2>
<p>The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets {}. This is where you define class members, such as methods or constructor.

The body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.

A class element can be characterized by three aspects:

Kind: Getter, setter, method, or field;
Location: Static or instance;
Visibility: Public or private.</p>
<h2>Constructor</h2>
<p>The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class â€” a SyntaxError is thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.

A constructor can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the super class.
